# RealTimeWeatherPipeline
A scalable data pipeline that ingests real-time weather data from multiple sources, processes it, and stores it in a data warehouse. Use the data to train a machine learning model to predict extreme weather events (e.g., hurricanes, floods, or heatwaves). The pipeline should include data validation, transformation, and visualization components.
